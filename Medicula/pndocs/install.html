        <h1>Medicula 2.0</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This module was developed to assist in some common issues I come across when deveoping modules for Postnuke. It's main purpose was to keep me from having to execute cleanup queries directly against a MySQL instance. Several of the tools in this module are low-level and although they follow the API, several checks may be skipped. They're designed to be as accurate as possible, but you must use your own judgement before deleting things. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Installation and Configuration </h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Simply install and activate this module like any other. There are no prerequisites. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This module is intented for  administrators only and only checks for full admin rights when running. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Below is a list of the tools available in Medicula.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Module Variables</strong> - This tool will find module variables that have no module in the system. Sometimes, these can be left laying around when testing an module init/remove routine did not work as expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Tables</strong> - This will report any tables that have no definition, or to be more exact, without a locatable <span class="style1">pntables.php</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Module Hooks</strong> - Shows any hooks that have no source module.</li>
            <li><strong>User Sessions</strong> - This tool allows you to delete any user session (except your current one).</li>
            <li><strong>Modules</strong> - This tool presents a list of <em>all </em>modules in the system regardless of state. It's main purpose is to allow you to &quot;force delete&quot; any module. Note that the module record is simply deleted from the database. No extra work like deleting related hooks is performed automatically. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test Data Generation</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If you have no &quot;bad&quot; data to work with, you can still test the operation of Medicula for yucks if you like. Just use the &quot;Test Data&quot; tool do create some junk records in the system that you can then delete. Fun! </p>
